### Choose side project:

The best advice:

1. Build skills
2. find the Company that you like -> try to figure out what they do (to invite developer/data scientist/ HR to talk about what they do day to day and create a project from there...)  -> show them your work and where to go from here...  
3. find a bug/issue in the COmpany you like and create a solution for that
Skip the job search page -> straight to the target

Personal project:
1.  timespan: 6 weeks
Facts to consider:
1.  curiosity
2.  can I learn something from it? what I did not expect? via negativa knowledge
3. do I have a story to tell afterwards?

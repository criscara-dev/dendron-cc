### How to invest - Best practices

1. Know very well 1 pair/currency/coin
2. make money on surprises (huge drops! or AfterShockPump) LONG: how to find support/resistance?
Answer the question: how many buyers are on the market?
3. Intra day trading : use 1hr chart, not less, if weekly use the daily one... did you ge the gist?
4. Holy Grail trading system: understand probabilities:
find the news as well! 
QFL 3 steps:
    1. look for an argument, disagreements
    2. read the Chart and find the story...normally how down the drops? dont predict.
    3. set alerts to know when the panic happens
    
trader doesn't have opinion on the market


Collect free coins: use Bots and then leave the choose to collect the gain in BASE coin (not the Quote or Market: BTC, USDT etc. )
5. create scanner that alert when a coin drop > 10% within 5minutes

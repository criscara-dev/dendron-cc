# Summary
- Antifragile: property of something that when beaten get stronger


## Aphorisms
- complex systems are full of interdependecies and nonlinear response


## Concepts
- The antifragile love randomless and uncertainty, incomplete understanding of things, opacity. Thanks to this we can: creating of a guide of nonpredictive decision making
- overprotection hurting us the most
- biggest fragilizer of humanity: (#skin-in-the-game) skin in the game (never as today non-risk-takers exerted so much control)
- illusion of predictability
- illusion of 'lecturing birds how to fly'
- Heuristics: rules of thumb that make things easy to implement even if not perfect...but let you not fooled by them
- fragility hate volatility
- practiotioner's ethos: 'skin in the game' or 'I eat my own cooking'
- ethical rule: if you see afrad and don't say it's a fraud, you're a fraud
- via negativa
- #Mithridization: is the result of an exposure to a small dose of a substance that, overtime, make someone immune to additional, large quantity to it
- #Homesis: a small quantity of a harmful substance that is actually beneficial for the organism acting as a medicine
- domain independence (of our mind): systems need some stress, some people can understand an idea in one domain (medicine) and fail to recognize in one another (socio-economic)
- #post-traumatic-growth: (ingenium mala saepe movent), difficult wakes up the genius, necessity is the mother of invention
- abundance is harder to handle than scarcity
- #overcompensation: if tired after a travel, train for some more exertion and then got to rest
- #redundancy: usually something unusual happen... redundancy to the resque. Not only for the body (2 kidney, 2 arms etc.) as well for goods you own.
- books and ideas are antifragile and get nourishment from attacks. #Criticism is a signal of attention
- #neurobiologist-discover: #harmful-to-health better acute than chronic stressors, and better when the former one give you enough time to recover and #overcompensate.
- machines vs organims: use it and lose it - vs - #use-it-or-lose-it
- #Black-swan-management-101: nature like diversity between organism rather than diversity within organism
- in order to progress, modern society should be treating ruined entrepreneurs as dead soldiers, at least using the same logic . Ref. #Also-sprach-Zarathustra acrobat


## Mis-conceptions
- #worst-case-scenario used to #estimate-future-risks. The problem is: when a worst case scenario happens, sometimes can be much worst the last one, or even a #Black-swan. Copy nature, assume worse harm is possible



## Ideas
- small commerce is the door to tolerance
- add #stressors of hunger may make humans live less than their full potential
- we concentrate better with habit of background noise than nothing at all
- get another job: jobs and professions fragile to reputational harm, aren't worth having. You need to be able to modify your exposure to control your position to reputational damage.
Almost no scandal would hurt an artist or writer
- people lend the most to those who need them the least


## definition
- fragilista: 
    - tend to mistake the unkwon for the no-existent
    - blid to the mysterious, impenetrable, what Nietzche called the 'Dyonisian', in life
    - engage in activities in which the beneficts are small but visible and side effects potentially severe and invisible
- #heuristic: rules of thumb



## Principles:
- #barbell-strategy: get into the situation 'love mistakes' and make lot but small in harm
- triad: fragile vs robust vs antifragile
- opacity: ignore newspaper: newspapers as constant source of causes for things. In #complex-systems, a complex world, the notion of cause is 'suspect', it's nearly impossible to detect. The predictability of a specific events is low, caused by #causal-opacity
- #proper-form vs #natural-movements
- superfocus VS super diffuse mode for every activities; never in the middle as multitasking that lead to do nothing really well

## Heuristics:
- He who has never sinned is less reilable than he who has made plenty of errors - though never the same error more than once - is more reliable than someone who has never made any.

from book 3

'nihil perditi' or 'I lost nothing' is a key phrase from Seneca's ouvre after adverse events.


from Nassim Taleb 

the retail traders risk prediction not based on complex argo but on the principle "less is more" -> become antifragile

The use of the Barbell Strategy

YOU CANNOT PREDICT IN GENERAL BUT YOU CAN PREDICT THAT THOSE WHO RELY ON PREDICTIONS ARE TAKING MORE RISKS, WILL HAVE SOME TROUBLE, PERHAPS EVEN GO BUST.
why?
SOMEONE WHO PREDICTS WILL BE FRAGILE TO PREDICTION ERRORS. AN OVERCONFIDENT PILOT WILL EVENTUALLY CRASH THE PLANE.
and NUMERCAL PREDICTION LEAD PEOPLE TO TAKE MORE RISKS.

THE PREDICTOR CAN PREDICT their own fragility
MAKE A BET ON THE COLLAPSE OF A FRAGILE UNIT

- [ ] is the loss of a certain SUM of money causing you greatr harm than benefit? 
Basically, possible outcome:
harm = 10
benefit = 1
Leave it!!!!
This is an ASYMMETRY (unfavourable one)

If I am in a condition of nothing to lose, I am ANTIFRAGILE and it's all gain

Antifragile -> Barbell Strategy =
REDUCTION of downside,
INCREASE of upside?

leave alone the middle!

"Better work very intensely for very short hours then do something else rather then be subjected to low intensity interminable office hours..."


Jensen's inequality -> 'philosopher's stone' | 'covexity bias'

chp 12

antifragility =  make more when right than be hurt when you're wrong = option

Artists, authors, and philosophers are much better of having a very small number of fanatics behind thme than a large number of people who appreciate their work.
The number of person that dislike my work don't count; there's not such thing as the opposite of buying my art, book and this provide me optionality.
Ex. of Wittgenstein with very few supporters but very influencial such as B Russell and J.M. Keynes...

Some options are expensive to purchase (insurance contracts etc.) but the ones we don't recognize are sometimes underpriced or not priced at all.

long gamma = beneficts from volatility and variability

risk is not just casino = real life risks!

implementation don't proceed from invention. -> requires luck and circumstances

Less is More

No money during research if it can lead to BS is not a loss, it will be for someone who loose the job and do nothing after that.

Cost of Search IS NOT a LOSS. ( it give OPTIONALITY and can lead to psositive Black Swan)
Office forniture IS NOT an INVESTMENT

confirmation fallacy -> Yddish proverb:" if the student is smart, the teacher take the credit"

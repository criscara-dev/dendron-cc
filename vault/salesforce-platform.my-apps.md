Notes on App
</summary>

Good example of how to build a simple but useful App.
- create custom object
- create a tab
- create App
- implement data model with schema builder
    - About the usage of schema-builder: when you add fields to the Objects from here, in order to see them, you need to add therm to the Page Layout
- change the Page Layout items
- add a Validation rules to a field
- create a process that on action update a record to a pre-defined value
- create a button as a global action to prompt a new record creation
    - When you create a Global-action, you need to add it to the Publisher Layouts in order to see it.
- create some reports and then a dashboard

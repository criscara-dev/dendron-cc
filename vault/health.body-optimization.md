- Using Science to Optimize Sleep, Learning & Metabolism

- red lights for a few minutes in the morning to optimize cell mythocondria via effect on photoreceptors in back of the retina... help repare them!
- circadian clock look for a lot of light in the morning to increase alertness
- watch sun light in the evening
- longer days (summer) melatonin less
- performance are optimize and injury reduced, when? (even in terms of STUDYING!)
    - 30' after waking up, 3 hrs after waking (rise of the body temperature), and 11 hrs after waking. basically when the temperature tend to peak
    - this means if I wake up at 7 am: 7:30, 10 am, 18:30
    - cycle learning is 90': start - focus - deep focus - tired
    - 20' naps/light non sleep/deep rest close after last read sentence/study
    it has been proven to accelerate learning to a significant degree, in terms of amount of info and retention of info (drug free boost)
- hypnosis can help... research more in AH video
- Nootropics: Magnesium-L-Threonate to get asleep, Modafinil...
- temperature in sleep:
    - ref. [Joseph_Takahashi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Takahashi) and [Abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756146/)
    - how to use cold to enhance energy/moods:
        - cold shower approach, to raise stress treshold, and try to resist shivering (a natural response to warm you up); try to relax during it... 4 sec technique
        - for lose fat (thermogenesis) -> succinate in blood -> increase fat brown, rich in mitochondria and help ti generate energy: DONT resist the shivering!

> fasting(few meat and nuts)/tyrosine -> epinephrine/norepinephrine/dopamine = pro activity
carbo/tryptophan -> serotonine = pro sleep
increase temperature extend the day...

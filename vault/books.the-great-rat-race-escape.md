## Money systems?

Money system (stocks, real estate etc.) only 1 part of my Systems
Money system NOT to create wealth but to maintain and grows/keep up to value

## Business system
To make money;
it needs specialized-unit and helps to give it the the right audience

- You need to skew values on the specialized-unit
Skew first:
1. primary attributes. the product itself: UI, prices, colors, raw materials, 
2. secondary attributes. Presentation, distribution, delivery (marketing stuff ) your website features...

> buy decision count many attributes; more your skewed values, more easy to sell


## Profit locus Strategy, the door the the rat escape

Not to wage-locus or salary-locus
ULL = ~~Uncontrollable Limited Leverage~~

### Specialize-unit strategy

1. first order: specialized-unit disconnected by time and possibly sold in large quantities
2. second order: from specialized skill, to make more money but limited by time (ex. making a website)

==The specialized unit should be difficult to create and easy to replicate==

## construct a leverage vehicle
1 u effort = 5 units of pay

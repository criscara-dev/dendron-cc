# The Great Rat Race Escape

## 1/5/10 Strategy

what do you nered to do in the next 30 days tog et started toward your 1 year vision?

Where to do you need to be in 1 year to have the groundwork for your 5 years vision?

Where to do you need to be in 5 years to be HALFWAY to your 10 years vision?

What is your vision for where you are in 10 years, personally, professionally and financially?

## Money systems?

Money system (stocks, real estate etc.) only 1 part of my Systems
Money system NOT to create wealth but to maintain and grows/keep up to value

## Business system
To make money;
it needs specialized-unit and helps to give it the the right audience

- You need to skew values on the specialized-unit
Skew first:
1. primary attributes. the product itself: UI, prices, colors, raw materials, 
2. secondary attributes. Presentation, distribution, delivery (marketing stuff ) your website features...

> buy decision count many attributes; more your skewed values, more easy to sell


## Profit locus Strategy, the door the the rat escape

Not to wage-locus or salary-locus
ULL = ~~Uncontrollable Limited Leverage~~

### Specialize-unit strategy

1. first order: specialized-unit disconnected by time and possibly sold in large quantities
2. second order: from specialized skill, to make more money but limited by time (ex. making a website)

==The specialized unit should be difficult to create and easy to replicate==

## construct a leverage vehicle
1 u effort = 5 units of pay

Scientist - Team Producer

GAP gross annual production
GAC gross annual consumption
ANE annual net existence = are you a producer or a cunsumer? GAP - GAC
NW net worth =  total ANEs or Total (Assets -liabilities)
R&D research and development

ANE results
- positive: you're a scientist
- negative: you're a rat

---


## Skew strategy

1 negative attribute can destroy 10 positives

## Principles

Specialize: go from specialized skills to specialize units
Imperfection: everything that can be improved is a business opportunity
Pond: if you want to catch more fish, you'll need to put yourself in a bigger body of water.
The Drake Equation: business plan are speculation; CENTS, TAM, skews, medium, replication, vision, and exit ideas suffice for a sufficient business plan
Desert of desertion: expectation that your business will be difficult, and motivation will wane, to the point of quitting
Baseball principle: one swing doesn't make a season;entrepreneurial career should be segregated into a at-bats, games, and seasons.
Probability Hacking: choices hack probabilities ( and better choices more, ence luck! )
Optimum experience Strategy: select a business that optimizes the customer experience
The engagement Strategy: if you want an endless book full of ideas waiting to be exploited, start engaging the world; you can't spot opportunity in a bubble!
Cinderella Principle
Critical path strategy: without a defined problem, also the solution remain undefined; put yourself in the face of a problem and you won't get lost.
The right book strategy: read the book that you need to read to solve the next problem in your 3A cycle
Search Cipher Strategy: hunt for search cipher to unlock knowledge
The Productocracy Strategy: pull not push;
Are you a pusher (seller of perceived/ not relative value) ? 3 Os: Obstructive, Obvious, Outrageous
Environmental hacking strategy ( it makes positive action easier and stalling inaction harder )
learn the marketminds and learn that "not everyine loves coffee"
Personality and purpose strategy: poeple are loyal to BRANDS and RELATIONSHIP, not CORPORATION AND BUSINESS: turn friendship into money!
"good isn't good enough principle": aim to excellent to be good, if you aim good, you'll be mediocre
Gold Star strategy
Fruit Tree strategy: hunt for fruit tree not peeled fruit (something work today won't work tomorrow; stategy working yesterday are packaged into expansive programs and amrketed as effective strategies of today)
Demostration Stategy: is a sale tactic; use it as a freemium sometimes, hook up with reciprocity
Gamification Startegy


## Ideas and Execution
All ideas sucks until brought to life by execution

## TUM vs TAM
total unreachable market vs Total addressable market
Chains, franchises, distribution, units, and licenses can transform TUm into TAM

## the 3A strategy - Applying the scientific method via an iterative process

Before Pivot:
Act
Assess
Adjust

**MANIPULATION RISK INDEX** FOR RETAILERS
How will the GRXTDI ( global retail x trading disinfo index ) ( or call it Pro-retailers) risk ratings be used?
The ~~ad~~ trading industry, including ~~advertisers~~, ~~ad~~ exchanges and platforms, often manipulate the market to make you trade more or wrong to get your money.
Now, you can use ~~these~~ our ratings to ensure you have not been manipulated.
You will have ~~Ad exchanges will have~~ real-time information on high-risk domains before ~~placing ads on~~ strart trading with them. 
~~Social platforms and search engines will have a neutral assessment to make high-risk domains less visible on their platforms.~~

there are different risk takers, whose who have more money and whose who have less. the latter, because of their fragility, need to predict and with much more accuracy ( Taleb, loc 2461). The ones with more money are ro bust or anti fragily so they don't need much forecasting.
So, how do you minimize harm from forecasting errors? This tool make you anti-fragile to the events of being SCAMMED.
Basically you can now control the exposition to the MANIPULATION system.

every time I got a subscription, I will donate a portion of the profit to a person that has lost money on wrong suggestion.

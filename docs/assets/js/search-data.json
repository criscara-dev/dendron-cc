Less in more (less exercises but the most effective; don't waste time with ones that are mildly effective)\n2. no jargon, no nerdy explanation , clear english (detail in book/links...)\n3. my skin in the game/experience and what I found not useful\n4. use of partner, skeleton, mannequin\n5. Skin in the game and I'm not a full time athlete BUT the goal is to achieve the splits and use them anytime* (almost...) so I prioritize strength over relax stretches. This require a lot more energy and willingness/determination.\n\n### The book/App\n\n### Who's this course for:\n1. this course is recommended for intermediate/advance athletes, not really for beginners (it can be dangerous...).\nYou need to be already \"quite flexible\" (reference) since here I am not try to help to get in shape but to reach an extreme range of motion. Tht's not for the fancy of heart. \n2. You need to put the time... and take your time to get the result you want. If you want to ge the split, you need to practice the split. It's a lifestyle, a flexible lifestyle.\n[Juji link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHBIKlluxkE)\n\n### Principles:\n1. Arch your back / stick the butt out\n2. Use hands to un-pinge yourself\n3. deep wide squats\n\n1. Pain is bad—it means you are hurting yourself and are making yourself weaker—so don't cause it.\n2. TO increase your range of motion you have to move (for dynamic range of motion) or stay (for static range of motion) close to your maximum range.\n3. To strengthen muscles at their full stretch, you need to tense them at that stretch.\n4. Discomfort is bad—so you must find positions at which you can comfortably tense your or fully relax them (depending on what kind of stretches you do) without any discomfort.\n\n### Fundamentals:\n- Exercises:\n1. Cossack Squats (side lunges)\nPiriformis???\n2. Seated good morning\n3. Low pancake circle,bounces, floating or like [here](https://www.gotrom.com/products/pancake-middle-splits/categories/165512/posts/516518), basic explore this position\n4. Wall middle-split\n    - No weight: 30 reps\n    - light weight / resistance band keep stretching\n    - weight...\n5. Pancake roll?!! as from Gymnastics bodies or [Straddle UP](https://www.gotrom.com/products/loaded-stretching/categories/165501/posts/526048), last one better probably\n6. Floor pancake weighted and/or try to elevate legs...or try to stand from this position\n7. Isometric: 3-5 sets of stretch and relax contractions, resting 3-5 minutes in between\n\nExtras:\n1. Adductor massage\n2. photos from the past:\n[Mary Lou Retton split](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/307230005810360094/)\n\n### Nutrition\n- collagen\n- Vit C\n\n### Reference\n<details><summary>\nWhat is Isometric Stretching?\n</summary>\nIsometric Stretching:\nTense strongly for a few seconds, relax, stretch within th\nfirst second of relaxation, tense again. Keep this\ncycle of tension and relaxation until you cannot stretch\nany more without pain. Hold the last tension to strengthen\nyour muscles at their greatest stretch.\n\n</details>\n","url":"https://criscara-dev.github.io/dendron-template/notes/68120d2b-7f40-4a15-b78e-6a5a868a7324.html","relUrl":"notes/68120d2b-7f40-4a15-b78e-6a5a868a7324.html"},{"doc":"Front Split","title":"Front Split","hpath":"health.movement.front-split","content":"\n## Front Split course\n\n### your Whys\nForget this:\n> \"Think of your greatest range of motion on the splits in the same way you’d think of your max on back squats, or the hardest trick you can do. You can only do it a couple times before you can’t do it anymore, and you can only do it when you’re fresh and after a long warm up.\"\nNo! You need to be able to perform the split on demand, no warm up.\nOtherwise your methods are ineffective.\nTo old to achieve the split?\nReally, it's all relative.\nPeople have different story and genetics and habits...\nI could generally say that if you’re a sedentary person, you would be facing increased difficulty in achieving full splits at any age. If you’ve been active but have never trained flexibility directly, then you would probably be facing increased difficulty from 50s?!.\nYounger you are easier it is even thought I recommend this type of training from the age of 18, since children have a different body, bones etc.I don't want to be more specific but I firmly believe that from an adult perspective, it's easier to rely on your strenght that on your natural fisiology.\n\n### Principles:\n1. The greatest and fastest gains are made by resetting the nervous control of muscle tension and length.\n2. Special strength exercises can stimulate the muscle fibers to grow longer and elongate the fibrous connective tissue associated with the muscle.\n3. measure your progress: you need to make a _Split Journal_ or bought mine;\n> You need to measure to see your progress: count set, reps and rest.\n4. barbell strategy:a void the middle: O-------o\n(stretch light always) -------- (train strength 2 times a week very hard)\n\n### Sequences of stretches in a workout:\n1. dynamic\n2. static active\n3. isometric (rest enough between series)\n4. relaxed\n\n### Exercises library:\n\n1. Lower back:\n    - stiff leg deadlift light\n2. Hamstring stretch: \n    - Jefferson curl\n    - good morning\n3. tight stretch: on the floor or at the wall\n3. calf stretch:\n    - elastic version\n    - step version\n    - leg on the wall\n4. front lunges:\n    -   contract tight / relax antagonists... and repeat\n5. lunges static and isometric with yoga block under buttock.\n6. loaded front-split (get creative ... and my way)\n7. tights stretch on the floor\n\n### Training routine:\n\n1. warm-up:\n    - warm-up\n    - deep squat (no weight)\n    - rotating tights onward and outward\n    - jumping rope and move arms/legs\n    - rotation\n\n2. training\n    - \n\n3. cool-down:\n    - lunges, relaxed stretch, jumping rope\n\nLoaded calf stretch\nLoaded [front-split](https://www.gotrom.com/products/loaded-stretching/categories/165501/posts/526016)\n\n### Tools:\n- thick Mat\n- weights (any kind that suit you)\n- some supplements:\n    - when inflammation is too much some Ibuprofen* or Aspirin\n    - bone broth and collagen (regularly, guess why...)\n    - the _Split Journal_*\n\n\n### EXTRAS and FAQs:\nFlexibility depends on emotional state and increase during excitement\n\n### References:\n- Stretching scientifically :Tom Kurz\n> Thomas Kurz’s book popularized isometric stretching methods. His book is a classic. If you want to read about the science of what is actually happening to your body when you stretch, the nervous system and muscular cells for example, and how to use that knowledge to\noptimize flexibility training, then you will love this book. This book was the most influential and important flexibility book I read.\n\n- Ido Portal:\n","url":"https://criscara-dev.github.io/dendron-template/notes/20373efa-ee50-4a7b-829a-cd2b73e8b25f.html","relUrl":"notes/20373efa-ee50-4a7b-829a-cd2b73e8b25f.html"},{"doc":"Body Optimization","title":"Body Optimization","hpath":"health.body-optimization","content":"\nreferences:\nexamine.com\n\n## Andrew Huberman Series on YouTube\n\n2021-03-22 18:50\n### How Your Nervous System Works & Changes\n\n- nervous system: brain + spinal chord\n- memory: pattern of electricity and neurons\n- attention can be under control when we're rested\n- neuron release chemicals with profound effects on our emotional state (*neuro modulators such as dopamine, seratonine, acetylcholine, epinefrine) they bias which neurons are going to be active\n- thoughts: allow reach into the past and anticipate the future that allow us engsge in things that are not only for the moment...\n- deliberate practice consist of 3 things: duration of the event, path and outcome\n- impulsivity is a lack of top-down control, of top-down processing that develop as well with age sometime not till 20 or more y.o.(it take down the fore brain),like alcohol\n- when you're shaking because you're angry is your lymbic system, the frontal cortex is in conflict with it.\n- neuroplasticity(ability to change the nervous system): you wanna know how to shape your behaviour\n- neuroplasticity:\n    - positive (adaptive) and self directed: how can I engage neuroplasticity?\n    the key to answer is understanding how awake or asleepy we are.\n    We can decide we can change our brain and the brain can change itself\n    Neuroplasticity is more difficult in adults that's why kids can learn more language without an accent.\n    In adults, neuroplasticity is regulated by gatekeepers: *neuromodulators (see above)\n    In adults appened easier with traumatic events 'cause of epinefrine and acetylcholine and it does that like an highlighter:\n    - epinefrine -> alertness and acetylcholine (in foods as eggs, meat and fish,dairy, Chocolate, peanut butter, brussels sprouts and broccoli as choline) -> marking the neurons active during this state of alertness and this process streghten the synapsis in the brain and let them more active in the future even without thinking too much\n    - HOW TO LEARN (sience): how much time you can continually focus on what you want to learn and agitation/strain as well (epinefrine release) to trigger neuroplasticity but the re-wiring happens during inactivity, such as sleep and sleep deep rest. study very hard and very intense and immediately after 20' deep rest/sleep, accellerate neuroplasticity\n    - SLEEP and FOCUS ex. if the people are learning a brain or motor skill with a tone palying in the background and that 'bell'/tone is playing during deep sleep that learning is much faster (it cuePs the nervous system) \n    - - Mastering the Autonomic Nervous System: role of autonomic nervous system in [ultradian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultradian_rhythm) rhythms and they continue during the day so the first 10' awake during let's say I'm trying to learn they'll be challanging and hard then I'll enter into the flow so I can go deep into learning then probably last 10' my attention level will go down again (time for a break!)\n    - when during the day you get anxious ask yourself when are you most focused? when are you least anxious? when you feel least motivated? discover when your sensation, perception etc. want to be engaged and not, you'll develop the ability to choose when to do one thing or the other.\n    \n\n2021-03-24 19:10\n### Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake\n- get consistency in sleep, get asleep better, sleep better, wake feeling better\n- 2 things: \n    - Adenosine building up (high): create a sleep hunger, more you're awake more it increase\n    caffeine 'in general' block the adenosine receptors but you need to explore your range\n    - circadian force (clock in our brain) regulate when we want to be awake or sleep\n- we wake-up because cortisol from adrenal glands and adrenaline and (epinefrine from your brain) getting high. This pulse happen early in the day and it's influenced by light.\n    - at the same time the melatonine get signal for sleepiness from the pineal gland: as an adult is release only at night based on your circadian but dont get external melatonine, specially for kids since it suppress onset puberty via blocking other hormons since it's getting activate.\n- get sunlight (energy) into your eyes (nervous cells) in the morning at sunrise or close to it. No through windows! it need to be direct! too late can cause anxiety disorder and depression and blood pressure. so Cortisol early in the day and via sunlight! if artificial you need a lot of blue and yellow light arrive in your retina in the morning.\n- to your body to know when is day or evening go outside al sunrise (early sunlight) and late afternoon at sunset (c.ca); light information set the circadian clock via eyes only.\n- bad effect of light: (because of artificial light): basically a lot of light, blue light early in the day, day and light after say 8pm in the evening\n- location of the lights in the evening should be low in the room and better yellow, red SO NO STRONG LIGHTS BETWEEN 11PM AND 4AM.\n- ==NSDR== practice to getting better at sleep NON SLEEP DEEP REST: \n    - yoganidra: 20' at the time: [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0u9GST_j3s&t=48s) and [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FroVfmOtaps)\n- [clinic hypnosis to re-wire sleep](https://reverihealth.com/)\n- what affect circadian time behavior? all drugs/compounds: what is safer?\n    - magnesium threonate -> GABA 300/440 gr, 30/60' before sleep\n    - theanine -> 100/200 gr, 30/60' before sleep\n    - apigenin <- from c hamomile (but increase estrogens)\n    - check examine.com for more info\n\n\n\n2021-03-19 19:34\n### How Foods and Nutrients Control Our Moods \n\n- nerve vague (transcranial nerve) and stimulation of relaxment\n- gut has sensors that sense... like sugar!, aka the gut feeling!\n- ex if I put sugar into a salty food...my body will sense it and without know that I'll crave for more of that food (just because it has sugar!)\n- rewards/predictions error and dopamine; amino acids in the gut detect which amino acids and L-tyrosine...that make dopamine. \nL-tyrosine Increase mood but as well brain fog. \nseratonine ...\n- [mucuna pruriens](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942911/) for dopamine, sperm motility etc...\n- L-carnitine increase pregnancy, POS (sindrome ovaio policistico), male fertility, decrease depression, autism\n- decrease L-carnitine\n- Bioma: pro and pre-biotics -> Healthy gut micro biom -> fermented foods\n- I want to promote a micro biom that is good for me, based on my habits and I've been raise (in terms of food) that influence the nervous system\n- ...Diets Agenda, every one works and still it depends...fermented foods always support your micro biom\n\n2021-03-18 11:33\n### Using Science to Optimize Sleep, Learning & Metabolism\n\n- red lights for a few minutes in the morning to optimize cell mythocondria via effect on photoreceptors in back of the retina... help repare them!\n- circadian clock look for a lot of light in the morning to increase alertness\n- watch sun light in the evening\n- longer days (summer) melatonin less\n- performance are optimize and injury reduced, when? (even in terms of STUDYING!)\n    - 30' after waking up, 3 hrs after waking (rise of the body temperature), and 11 hrs after waking. basically when the temperature tend to peak\n    - this means if I wake up at 7 am: 7:30, 10 am, 18:30\n    - cycle learning is 90': start - focus - deep focus - tired\n    - 20' naps/light non sleep/deep rest close after last read sentence/study\n    it has been proven to accelerate learning to a significant degree, in terms of amount of info and retention of info (drug free boost)\n- hypnosis can help... research more in AH video\n- Nootropics: Magnesium-L-Threonate to get asleep, Modafinil...\n- temperature in sleep:\n    - ref.
